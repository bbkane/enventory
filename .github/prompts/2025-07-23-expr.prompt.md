Add an `--expr` flag to the `env list` command. It should look like:

```bash
enventory env list \
    --expr 'expression'
```

This flag should allow users to filter environments based on a specific expression.

- Update `models/env.go` `EnvService.EnvList` command to accept an `args EnvListArgs` struct that includes the `Expr *string` field.
- Update `app/env.go` to handle the new `Expr` argument in the `EnvList` method if its not `nil`. Before returning the environments, filter them based on the provided expression. Use #githubRepo expr-lang/expr to see how to do this
- Update all callsites of `EnvList` to pass the `Expr` argument. Initialize the `Expr` field to nil but add a TODO comment so I know to change that later.
- Run the tests to ensure everything works as expected.
